# audio-visualization

Description:
Greetings! The files in this repository are the various versions of my attempts to analyze and visualize music via code.

Dependencies/version information:
Make sure you have installed Tkinter, Librosa, and Pygame in order to run. I am using Python 3.9.16, but the programs should run on any Python version between 3.8 and 3.10. 

Running the code:
The programs are intended to run using MP3 files. See in-code comments to make sure you include your filepaths correctly. Once you run a file, the audio file is analyzed automatically, but there is usually a button to press in order start the visualization. Look at your terminal for some cool information throughout the process. Enjoy!
